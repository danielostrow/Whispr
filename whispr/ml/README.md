# Machine Learning (ML)

This directory contains the core machine learning models for the project.

## Modules

- **`clustering.py`**: Implements clustering algorithms to group similar audio segments.
- **`separation.py`**: Contains models for sound source separation, such as separating speech from background noise.
- **`vad.py`**: Implements a Voice Activity Detection (VAD) model to identify the presence of speech in an audio signal.
