- **`features.py`**: Extracts features from audio signals, such as MFCCs, spectral contrast, and chroma features.
- **`framing.py`**: Handles the framing of audio signals into smaller chunks for analysis.
- **`spatial.py`**: Contains functions for spatial audio processing, like beamforming and sound source localization.
