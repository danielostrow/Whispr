# Digital Signal Processing (DSP)

This module contains functions for signal processing tasks, such as feature extraction and spatial audio analysis.

## Modules

- `features.py`: Extracts acoustic features like MFCCs and energy.
- `spatial.py`: Estimates spatial cues like Interaural Time Difference (ITD) and Interaural Level Difference (ILD).
- `framing.py`: Logic for windowing signals into frames.
